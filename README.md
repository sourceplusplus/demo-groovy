## What is this?

This project holds Groovy-based feature demonstrations for [Source++](https://github.com/sourceplusplus/sourceplusplus),
the open-source live coding platform. These demonstrations are meant to be used as a reference for how to use Source++
in your own projects.

## How to use?

Install the Source++ plugin via the JetBrains Marketplace by searching for: `Source++`.
Alternatively, you can download the Source++ plugin directly from [here](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12033-source-).

Once the plugin is installed, check out the demos below. Each demo contains instructions explaining how to use it.

> Note: You do not need to run this code to play with the demos. This application is hosted on our publicly accessible servers.

## Demos

### [Tail Logs](./src/main/groovy/spp/demo/command/TailLogs.groovy)

This demonstration shows how to tail logs from a running application. Logs can be filtered by individual statements,
methods, and classes. The **Tail Logs** command works for any application that uses a logging framework that is
supported by Source++.

For more information, see the [TailLogs](./src/main/groovy/spp/demo/command/TailLogs.groovy) class.
